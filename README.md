# MEDIA EDITOR

> Python scripts to perform basic media manipulation.  I have been using these script
to create music and spoken poetry videos.

## Features 
(these are rough implementation and aren't exposed via a clean interface)

1. Merge audio clip and video clip
2. Loop a video clip to match the duration of the audio. This comes in handy when you want to use AI generated
clip, which is usually small eg 4 seconds, to match the audio duration
3. Overlay sound:wq
s, for instance overlay a sound effect over narration.
